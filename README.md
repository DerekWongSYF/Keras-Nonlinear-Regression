# Non Linear Regression Example with Keras and Tensorflow Backend

The data for fitting was generated using a non linear continuous function. It has five inputs and one output. Both the training set and validation set have around 1000 datapoints. 

### Y = SIN(A) x EXP(B) + COS(C x C) + POWER(D,5) - TANH(E)
